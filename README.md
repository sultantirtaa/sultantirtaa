# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sultan Tirta Firdaus, you can call me Sultan â€” by day, I'm a Data Specialist at [PT Riset Perkebunan Nusantara](https://rpn.co.id/);
by night, i'm a coding enthusiast with coffee in one hand and tutorials on screen.<br>
I mostly handle research admin, especially projects funded by the Indonesian Palm Oil Fund [(BPDPKS)](https://www.bpdp.or.id/).
But beyond the spreadsheets, I'm exploring the world of programming one line of code at a time.<br>
Into data, research, or just enjoy building cool stuff? Let's connect on [LinkedIn!](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sultantirta/)
